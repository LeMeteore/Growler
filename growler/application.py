"""
Defines the base application (App) that defines a 'growlerific' program. This
is where the developers should start writing their own application, as all of
the HTTP handling is done elsewhere. The typical use case is a single instance
of an application which is the endpoint for a (or multiple) webserver.

Currently the only webserver which can forward requests to a Growler App is the
growler webserver packaged, but it would be nice to expand this to other
popular web frameworks.

A simple app can be created raw (no subclassing) and then decorate functions or
a class to modify the behavior of the app. (decorators explained elsewhere)

class Application:
    """
    A Growler application object. You can use a 'raw' app and modify it by
    decorating functions and objects with the app object, or subclass App and
    define request handling and middleware from within.

    The typical use case is a single App instance which is the end-point for a
    dedicated webserver. Upon each connection from a client, the
    _handle_connection method is called, which constructs the request and
    response objects from the asyncio.Stream{Reader,Writer}. The app then
    proceeds to pass these req and res objects to each middleware object in its
    chain, which may modify either. The default behavior is to have a
    growler.router as the last middleware in the chain and finds the first
    pattern which matches the req.path variable, and calls this function.

    If at any point in the middleware chain, res is found to be in the 'closed'
    state, we simply stop the chain. If after the last middleware is called and
    the res is NOT in the 'closed' state, an error will be thrown. If at any
    point in the middleware chain an exception is thrown, the exception type is
    searched for in a chain of error handlers, and if found is called, with the
    expectation that res will be closed. If it is NOT closed at this point or
    if a handler was not found, the default implementation throws a '500 -
    Server Error' to the user.

    Each middleware in the chain can either be a normal function or an
    asyncio.coroutine. Either will be called asynchronously. There is no
    timeout variable yet, but I think I will put one in later, to ensure that
    the middleware is as responsive as the dev expects.
